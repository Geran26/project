/*Geran Dunlop's (3324608) code for the ENGG1003 Assignment 1. This code performs 6 different tasks, rotation encryption and 
decryption, substitution encryption and decryption, rotation decryption with unknown key and substitution decryption with an 
unknown key. To choose which operation to perform please enter a number 1 - 6 in the file called 'stdinInput'; 1 for rotation
encryption, 2 for rotation decryption, 3 for substitution encryption. 4 for substitution decryption, 5 for rotation decryption
with an unknown key, 6 for substitution decryption with an unknown key. Text to be encrypted and decrypted needs to be written
in the file labelled 'Input.txt' on the first line, with the key number or alphabet written on the 2nd line of the file. If no
key needs to be inputted only write on the first line of the file. The program is run using the custom run script 'runProject'
accessed by pressing the drop down menu on the triangle run symbol and selecting 'runProject'. */

/*Decryption of a text using substitution decryption without a cipher key. This fucntion takes no arguments and returns no values, 
it simlpy makes the switch statement above neater. First it reads text from a file and stores it character by character in an array.
It then converts the case to uppercase if required. This decryption uses a statistical analysis attack to determine the most common
letters in the encrypted message. The amount of each letter in the cipher text is recorded in two arrays, one of which is then 
ordered from largest to smallest Another array then gets filled with the letters in order of their frequency in the cipher text. 
This is then used as the cipher key. The cipher text is compared with this key and the appropriate letters of a hard coded regular
letter frequency are substituted. The decrypted message is then printed to stdout and the file for a visual analysis and from there
further substitutions counld be made manually. This function requires that the cipher text be on the first line of the file. This 
method of statistical analysis will be fairly accurate for large sections of text, accurate enough to determine further 
substitutions for medium length text but fairly inaccurate for small sections of text as the frequency of the letters is unlikely
to correspond with the standard statistical frequency of each letter.*/
